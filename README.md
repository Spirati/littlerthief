# Little(r) Thief
A game engine loosely based off of the Ace Attorney visual novel format, written in pure C using SDL2.

## Directories:
- `assets`: Assets used by the game
    - `assets/font`: Font atlases for various typefaces. These are generated by an external tool, but follow a simple format

## Compiling:
I wrote this on Windows, so this only applies there, but I'll add instructions for other platforms once I get there.
Open up the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt **(x64)**, navigate to the project root, and run:
```
cl.exe \
    /Zi \
    /Fe:build/littlethief.exe \
    /Fo:build/ \
    /Fd:build/ \
    /I:include/ \
    /I:include/sdl \
    /I:include/sdl_image \
    src/**.c \
    shell32.lib \
    lib/sdl/SDL2main.lib \
    lib/sdl/SDL2.lib \
    lib/sdl_image/SDL2_image.lib \
    /link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS
```
Maybe someday I'll convert this to a makefile, but for now you can just paste it into a `.bat` or a build task or something. Omit `/Zi` for a release build.
